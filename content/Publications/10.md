_Abstract_

When functional data are observed on parts of the domain, it is of interest to recover the missing parts of curves. 
Kraus (2015) proposed a linear reconstruction method based on ridge regularization. Kneip and Liebl (2019) argue that
 an assumption under which Kraus (2015) established the consistency of the ridge method is too restrictive and propose
 a principal component reconstruction method that they prove to be asymptotically optimal. In this note we relax the restrictive
 assumption that the true best linear reconstruction operator is Hilbertâ€“Schmidt and prove that the ridge method achieves
 asymptotic optimality under essentially no assumptions. The result is illustrated in a simulation study.
