_Abstract_

Functional data are usually assumed to be observed on a common domain. However, it is often the case that some 
portion of the functional data is missing for some statistical unit, invalidating most of the existing techniques 
for functional data analysis. The development of methods able to handle partially observed or incomplete functional 
data is currently attracting increasing interest. We here briefly review this literature. We then focus on 
discrimination based on principal component analysis and illustrate a few possible methods via simulation studies 
and an application to the AneuRisk65 data set. We show that carrying out the analysis over the full domain, where 
at least one of the functional data is observed, may not be the optimal choice for classification purposes.
