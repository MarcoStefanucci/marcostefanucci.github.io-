_Abstract_

We consider classification of functional data into two groups by linear classifiers based on one-dimensional projections
 of functions. We reformulate the task of finding the best classifier as an optimization problem and solve it by the
 conjugate gradient method with early stopping, the principal component method, and the ridge method. We study the empirical
 version with finite training samples consisting of incomplete functions observed on different subsets of the domain and show
 that the optimal, possibly zero, misclassification probability can be achieved in the limit along a possibly nonconvergent
 empirical regularization path. We propose a domain extension and selection procedure that finds the best domain beyond the
 common observation domain of all curves. In a simulation study we compare the different regularization methods and investigate
 the performance of domain selection. Our method is illustrated on a medical dataset, where we observe a substantial improvement
 of classification accuracy due to domain extension.
